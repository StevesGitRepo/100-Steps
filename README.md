100 STEPS is structured into three Javascript functions.

Hello World!
The "getValues" function takes in the inputted values from the page. The "parseInt" function parses the values into integers. The values are checked and an alert populates if integers are not used. Progressive Boolean conditional statements create alerts if users input integers outside the scope of the app.

The "generateNumbers" function generates an array. A for-loop is used to generated integers at the user-inputted starting value (startValue) to the ending value (endValue). Numbers are returned.

Finally, the "displayNumbers" function creates a string of the results. Another for-loop is used to determine odds or evens using the modulo operator (%). Bold weight and a custom color is assigned to the even integers using a CSS element. The "results" variable then feeds the integers into the table on the page.
